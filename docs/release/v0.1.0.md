# Evidra v0.1.0

Evidra v0.1.0 is the first public release of an Argo CD-first investigation and evidence layer.
It provides a Change-centric flow to explain deployment outcomes and export audit-ready evidence.

## Highlights

- Change-centric investigation workflow
- Evidence Explorer in standalone mode and Argo CD extension mode
- Correlation search by app, revision, and external annotations
- Deterministic JSON evidence export

## Investigation trust anchors

- Change Summary panel: application, target, initiator, operation window, result.
- Stable Change permalink for shareable investigation context.
- Observational degradation-after-deploy indicator (no causal claim).
- Evidence freshness/completeness hint in Change view.
- Export metadata includes change-level context and deterministic hash.

## Quickstart

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make evidra-demo
```

## Known limitations

- Scope is limited to Argo-first investigation use cases.
